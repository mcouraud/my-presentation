    <h3> "Change your life, learn to code" </h3>
    <p>
      In October 2018, I chose to attend a 9-week coding bootcamp at Le Wagon after graduating from Kedge Business school, and I can tell now that it was the best decision of my life.
      Not only am I passionate about my job, but I keep learning every day, within a team of supportive people, working remotely from Toulouse.
